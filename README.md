## Rationale

Google Reader shutted down on July 1st 2013. Since then I've been unable to find another RSS reader solution that had the same feeling while still being simple enough and provide a fluid interface.

This project is born with this need in mind and also trying to develop a Clojurescript application that doesn't need a server-side backend in order to provide functionalities of these services.

## Technologies

- Clojurescript
- Om + React.js
- HTML5 techlonologies
  - Web Workers (asynchronous feed reading)
  - Local Storage (state storage)
  - IndexedDB (local feed items storage)
  - Shadow DOM (description css sandboxing)
  - Local file reading (import ompl files)
  - Service workers (offline capabilities)
  - Web RTC (peer to peer sharing)
