     :description "<p><img alt=\"EPIC Stories\" src=\"http://blog.taiga.io/images/2014-11-20_epic-stories/epic_stories.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /> <small> <em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/author/Kulawat-Wongsaroj\" title=\"Kulawat Wongsaroj\">Kulawat Wongsaroj</a> from the post <a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/articles/visualize-big-picture-agile\" title=\"Visualizing the Big Picture of your Agile Project\">Visualizing the Big Picture of your Agile Project</a>.</em></small></p> <p>Last week we had an interesting email exchange amongst the team at <a href=\"https://taiga.io\" title=\"Taiga.io\">Taiga.io</a>. It went like this: The question was a recurring one amongst users of our platform</p> <p><strong>What is an epic story?</strong></p> <p>I answered:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to the inventors of agile, An EPIC story is a large undefined user story that must be subdivided.</p> <p>An EPIC must be broken down into smaller user stories. As far as I recall, user stories should follow the \"INVEST\" pattern where \"I\" stands for \"independent\" and \"V\" for \"valuable\". In my opinion, an EPIC can make sense and be visible, perhaps in a different color so as to reflect its state as an embryonic proto-story, but not part of the application structure in the guise of a module or layer.</p> <p><strong>That leads to other questions:</strong></p> <p>All those subdivided and tiny user stories, would not deploy alone, they are related.</p> <p>Indeed, this is where the idea of EPIC can be useful as an aggregator of user stories. That is to say as an encompassing module. But you have to be careful as it can be very confusing to manage such a thing on any project management tool, or even on paper. It makes it very difficult for any client to prioritize as there are too many dependencies. Using tags will probably help here I think.</p> <p><strong>Are my designer’s prototypes a big story, an EPIC?</strong></p> <p>If so, then that can be either a problem of documentation, or that the designer is working on prototypes before user stories are specified, or that they’ve been broken down by the back end engineers with all of what that entails, or some combination of all three. If the user stories are independent they should each have a very clear prototype. You shouldn't have to dig deep to see which button refers to the user story that you are addressing at any specific moment.</p> <p><strong>But aren’t EPICS a way to group large functional blocks of the project, For example an API, the front part, Mobile?</strong></p> <p>No. But you can call these \"modules\" or something similar to that, but these modules don't have any specific value. The word EPIC is used by Mike Cohn in his book, so it is the official:-). I searched Google and found this wonderful article by Mike Cohn talking about all this: <a href=\"https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/spotlight/mike-cohn/march-2014/agile-user-stories-epics-and-themes\" title=\"Agile User Stories, Epics and Themes\">Agile User Stories, Epics and Themes</a>. It's a copy of this 2001 article: <a href=\"http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/stories-epics-and-themes\" title=\"User Stories, Epics and Themes\">Agile User Stories, Epics and Themes</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Following this email exchange, <strong>we had a meeting to define what an EPIC could look like on <a href=\"https://taiga.io\" taiga=\"taiga\" title=\"Taiga.io\">Taiga</a>?</strong></p> <p>EPICS can be useful, and serve as the basis for a preliminary analysis, it can be the framework for conversations, diagrams, wireframes, even prototypes. That's information we want to capture.</p> <p>If we divide and EPIC into smaller stories, where do we put all that information? We decided that in <a href=\"https://taiga.io\" taiga=\"taiga\" title=\"Taiga.io\">Taiga</a> the final format will be a user story marked as EPIC and distinguished in the backlog by its color. The EPIC and all its derived user stories Will be related to one another and in that manner we will be able to access all the previous information should it be necessary.</p> <p>As a bonus, that aggregation of user stories into an EPIC Will allow us to then track the number of stories that have been completed, providing us with something similar to a module or a grouping of related stories.</p> <p>As an additional bonus, the stories that may emerge from an epic may not necessarily pertain to the project at hand, perhaps they ought to belong to a subproject. We could then have a \"base\" project in the form of: \"Main Company\" an EPIC named \"Christmas Campaign\", user stories pertaining to that EPIC in the sub-project, \"Marketing Department\" such as \"TV Spots\". All of these being related and trackable from the EPIC itself.</p> <p>What do you think?</p>"

     :description "retroworks writes Motherboard.vice offers an interesting scoop from the hacked Sony Pictures email trove. A plan championed by Polish marketing employee Magda Mastalerz was to upload false versions of highly-pirated Sony programming, effectively polluting torrent sites with false positives. For example, a \"Hannibal\"-themed anti-piracy ad to popular torrent sites disguised as the first episode. Sony Pictures legal department quashed the idea, saying that if pirate sites were illegal, it would also be illegal for Sony Pictures to upload onto them. There were plans in WW2 to drop phony counterfeit currency to disrupt markets, and I wonder why flooding underground markets with phony products isn't widespread. Why don't credit card companies manufacture fake lists of stolen credit card numbers, or phony social security numbers, for illegal trading sites? For that matter, would fake ivory, fake illegal porn, and other \"false positives\" discourage buyers?

     :description "Long ago beyond the stars a civilization rose from dust and puddles to spread the gospel of “agile software development” across many worlds. Over time these worlds diverged into two distinct tribes, known as “Team A” and “Team B” (for they were truly unimaginative beings in the ways of names). Both tribes prospered, delivering software throughout the galaxy, but over many generations Team A grew to believe the source of their success was a mysterious force known as “Story Points”. Team A evolved an elaborate ritual that they performed during their traditional bi-weekly gatherings known as “Sprint Planning”. Team A believed these rituals allowed them to accurately predict the future. Abandoning the process of deep thought and discussion, Team A eventually focused their entire development process on these “points”, which for some reason existed only in quantities of 1, 2, 3, 5, and (very rarely) 8.While both tribes continued to ship software, fealty to this numeric master began to visibly distort Team A’s demeanor and appearance until travelers from other galaxies could easily tell which of the two tribes they had encountered. Those from Team A came to be known as victims of \"Fibonacci’s Curse\". Let us go now, across space and time in the blink of an eye to gaze upon two such parallel development efforts..."

     :description "&lt;p&gt;Clojure/conj 2014 is in the books. This was the fifth Conj and by far the biggest, with 500 attendees and 21 speakers. In fact, the conference set some new bars. It was the first time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Conj has crested 500 attendees&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=\"http://youtube.com/clojuretv\"&gt;talk videos&lt;/a&gt; were posted same-day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://clojure-conj.org/grants\"&gt;opportunity grants&lt;/a&gt; were awarded&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;more than 60% of attendees were first-timers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the videos have gone online at &lt;a href=\"http://youtube.com/clojuretv\"&gt;ClojureTV&lt;/a&gt; they have been collectively viewed more than 36,000 times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to extend some thanks to people who made the event such a success. &amp;nbsp;First, Lynn and Alex, for planning, organizing and staffing the event. &amp;nbsp;Next, to the speakers: it isn't easy getting up in front of that crowd, and you did it with style, and aplomb. &amp;nbsp;Third, to the &lt;a href=\"http://clojure-conj.org\"&gt;sponsors&lt;/a&gt;, whose support made so much of the event possible. And finally, to the attendees, without whom there is no event, and no purpose. &amp;nbsp;You *are* the show.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope that everyone who attended found the content and the community they were expecting and some surprises in addition. For those who weren't able to attend, you can check out the videos online, and there is always Clojure/west and next year's Conj. &amp;nbsp;We hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;"
